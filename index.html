      <h1 class="w3-center">Financial Management </h1><br>
      <p class="w3-large"> 1. Financial management may be defined as the area or function in an organization which is concerned with profitability, expenses, cash and credit.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-black w3-hide-medium"> It is a well-known truth that, on average, women earn less than their counterparts for the same work around the world. As a result, their lifetime earnings are lower than males in identical occupations, which also reduces their retirement funds and savings. </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-black w3-hide-medium"> Furthermore, as seen by data on women's labor force participation rates, many women choose not to work for a variety of reasons. For example, according to the World Economic Forum's 2018 report, India has a 66 percent gender disparity in terms of economic participation.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-black w3-hide-medium"> 2. Also, despite the fact that the law provides equal rights, the practical situation is that men tend to own properties in the family. So, if women do not have their own financial backup, they end up having to rely on others to fund their old age.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-black w3-hide-medium"> Unlike men, women think more about the future and always save for a rainy day; therefore, they may be more attuned to think about savings, rather than investing. However, reality is not often on their side when the advice about personal finance generally given is geared more towards men - who are willing to invest in stocks, start-ups, big projects. </p>

        <h1 class="w3-center">Pay Gap </h1><br>
        <p class="w3-large"> 1. In Indonesia, according to UN Women, women earn 23% less than men and high-paying jobs are dominated by men.</p>
        <a href= " https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---travail/documents/publication/wcms_467449.pdf
        "target="_blank"> Gender pay gap in Asia </a>
        <p class="w3-large">2. In Vietnam (1), “The gender wage gap favoring men has persisted and is currently at 13.7 percent for formal workers, according to the Vietnam Country Gender Equality Profile 2021 released this week by UN Women.”</p>
        <p class="w3-large"> 3. Proposed solutions:</p>
        <p class="w3-large">+ Raise awareness about the situations</p>
        <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13XU4fMlN3w" target="_blank">Watch a video about gender wage gap</a>
        <p class="w3-large">+ Raise the minimum wage. Because women account for over two-thirds of federal minimum wage workers, raising the minimum wage would have an immediate impact on closing the gender pay gap and pulling women out of poverty.</p>
        <p class="w3-large">+ Increase pay transparency implementation so that women can determine if you’re being compensated fairly as men or not.</p>
        <p class="w3-large">+ Create employee union for more equal pay policies promoted by unions, such as standardized rates, pay transparency, and discrimination grievance procedures. </p>
        <p class="w3-large">+ Expand paid family and medical leave so that women don’t have to lose their jobs after giving birth.</p>
        <p class="w3-large">+ Improve work-life balance at workplace</p>
        <p class="w3-large">+ Eliminate gender discriminations among activities so that men feel comfortable when going to the kitchen or doing other “women’s jobs”</p>
